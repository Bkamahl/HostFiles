# HostFiles
My try at gathering HostFiles:
Most of the files in the Other_Host_Files folder have their names as the publishers/owners name or what the project/file was called

I did create my own HostFile first from a large collection of HostFiles I found online but then removed and added my own domains

I also created a IP Allow file, generally very trusted IPs such as Steam, Epic Games, Fortnite, and big applications and servers like that

I try keeping false positives to a minimum, but it is a very large list from the online world so there are some FPs, if you do find some please make a list of them instead of posting an issue for one domain, unless that domain is the only one you found/need

Don't expect a Anti Windows Telemetry from me, if you want one use CrazyMax's HostFiles and IP lists as they don't have FPs and are great

:D

Currently can't work on this project, situations in life, I will work on it as soon as I possibly can. Which should be around 2 maybe 3 months from 12/14/18 :) sorry for the inconvenience.
